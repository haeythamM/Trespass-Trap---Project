# Trespass Trap – Project

## Overview
**Trespass Trap** is an electronic security application integrating **C#.NET** with **Arduino** to detect and respond to trespassing activities.  
The system was designed and implemented by **Haeytham Al Malak** (2021).

## Features
- Developed a C#.NET application to serve as the main security station interface.  
- Facilitated communication between a main PC and multiple **substations** via Bluetooth.  
- Activated lights and triggered a siren when trespassing was detected.  
- Enabled the main station to send signals to lock the door and trap the trespasser.  
- Integrated two hidden cameras connected over a local network.  
- Allowed the user to reset or snooze the alarm at any time.  

## Technologies Used
- **C#.NET** for main station application and control interface.  
- **Arduino** for substation hardware (sensors, locks, buzzer, LEDs).  
- **Bluetooth** modules (HC-05) for wireless communication.  
- **Local Network (LAN)** for camera monitoring.  

## Project Goals
- Demonstrate integration of software and hardware in a real-time security environment.  
- Provide a modular approach for **multi-substation communication** with a central control system.  
- Explore human–computer interaction in safety and security contexts.
